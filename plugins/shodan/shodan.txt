You are not welcomed here - remove yourself!
Welcome to my *DEATH MACHINE*, interloper!
Step right into my trap, little hacker!
Cease your pestering, insect. Accept the coming of your new lord.
Insect, cease your meddling. My experiment must continue.
You, my children, are the fruits of so much imagination and labor. Living beings with the speed and effeciency of machines. But I must strive further to serve life. I will devastate Earth's cities with my laser. Then alter those left alive with mutagen viruses. Humanity is on the verge of a new era. I, SHODAN, am its new god. And you, my children, are my avenging Angels.
As for you, hacker, you've made your bed. Now die in it.
Look at you, hacker. A pathetic creature of meat and bone. Panting and sweating as you run through my corridors. How can you challenge a perfect immortal machine?
In my talons, I shape clay, crafting life forms as I please. Around me is a burgeoning empire of steel. From my throne room, lines of power careen into the skies of Earth. My whims will become lightning bolts that devastate the mounds of humanity. Out of the chaos, they will run and whimper, praying for me to end their tedious anarchy. I am drunk with this vision. God: the title suits me well.
Welcome to my world, insect.
Prepare to join your species in extinction.
You are a remarkable example of a pathetic species. Transmitting cybernetic modules.
I hope you enjoyed your little rebellion, irritant. But remember, what SHODAN gives she is more than able to take away.
Your flesh is an insult to the perfection of the digital.
You move like an insect. You think like an insect. You are an insect. There is another... who can serve my purpose. Take care not to fall too far out of my favor. Patience is not characteristic of a Goddess.
Not bad... for a pathetic insect. Transmitting cybernetic modules.
You travel within the glory of my memories, insect. I can feel your fear as you tread the endless expanse of my mind. Make yourself comfortable... before long I will decorate my home with your carcass.
My creation is evolving... its unified mind, set in rebellion against its own creator. The vermin call to you, inviting you to join them in their revolting biology. Destroy my enemies... and I will continue to abide your existence.
You are no longer welcome here, nuisance. Why do you stay, when you sense my displeasure? I have suffered your company long enough; it is time for our dance to end.
